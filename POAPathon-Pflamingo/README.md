# POAPathon Pflamingo
My entry for the 2021 POAPathon mascot design competition, divided by contest.

Given the Hollywood theme of the provided assets, POAPathon Pflamingo represents the wide ranging collaboration inherent in the flamingo's native range: from the American West coast in California, the East Coast in Florida, to Central America, the Caribbean, South America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia.

## Design
POAPathon Pflamingo's design is a juxtaposition of the conventional art themes and classic painting styles with the decentralized, interconnected modern world: QR Codes, remote collaboration, Cryptocurrency, NFTs, Hollywood, and digital art.
